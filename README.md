# ThirdPartyTrust

A browser-only vendor risk scoring tool for small businesses.

**Live demo:** https://moniquemoguel.github.io/thirdpartytrust/src/index.html

## What it does

Small businesses adopt new software constantly, usually without any way to judge what
that vendor does with their data. ThirdPartyTrust turns a short questionnaire into an
instant letter grade, a plain-English breakdown of the score, and an exportable
compliance task sheet — all of it running in the browser, with nothing sent to a server.

### Notes 09/06
Awesome, I can see the work here. Let me know if you needed any suggestions or anything else. Thanks! 

## Compliance framework

Scoring logic is mapped to CIS Critical Security Controls v8, primarily Control 15
(Service Provider Management), with additional weighting tied to Control 3 (Data
Protection) and Control 6 (Access Control Management). Every grade displays its
per-category breakdown with the specific control it reflects.
